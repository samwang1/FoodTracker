# Motivation
Before senior year of high school, I never took my health seriously. I never cared about the types of 
foods that entered my body and lived a sedentary lifestyle. It was not until later that year that I 
realized my health was something to be concerned about â€“ my grandfather and uncle were diagnosed with 
cancer and unfortunately both passed away. Seventeen-year-old me felt helpless as all I could do was 
watch them go in and out of chemotherapy sessions, only to come home and be bedridden. I also have a 
family history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity. These factors made me realize 
that I needed to do something to combat the issues of declining health in my family. Because of my 
interests in computer science and technology, I want to find ways to use software to battle the health 
problems that come with a sedentary lifestyle. Not only do I want to help my loved ones, I also want 
to expand my toolset such that I can affect people outside of my immediate community.

With my limited coding skills, I was already able to develop a simple meal tracking app. I want to
continue to improve this app by scaling it up such that it can be beneficial to a wider array of
people, such as adding a feature to track one's daily macros. Building this app serves as practice
in developing in an iOS environment, and I hope to combine the skills I've gained here with my
interest of solving problems using data structures and algorithms to create more interesting
projects in the future.
